Per Product Add-on for WooCommerce Shipping Pro on WooCommerce Stores

== Description ==

= Per Product Add-on for WooCommerce Shipping Pro =

Per product shipping allows you to define different shipping costs for products based on shipping destination, product category, shipping class etc.

This plugin is an add-on for Shipping Pro Plugin and does not work independently.

= Cases handled by Per Product Add-on =

In some cases, you would like to have the flexibility to define shipping costs at the product level. Shipping Pro Per Product Add-on handles the following cases

<strong>Per Product Shipping cost multipliers</strong>: This helps when you want to define the shipping cost as a multiple of a certain unit value. Assume your store sells furniture & accessories and you want to define shipping cost as given below

Chair    - 10 USD, 
Table	 - 15 USD, 
Wardrobe - 30 USD

You can set shipping cost per unit as 10 USD (in Shipping Pro plugin) and then define shipping cost units of each product as below. 

Chair     - 1 unit, 
Table	  - 1.5 units, 
Wardrobe  - 3 units

Now when Shipping Pro calculates shipping costs for products, shipping units will be counted based on the value of these multipliers

A much detailed example with the calculation logic is available <a href="https://www.xadapter.com/2016/11/14/woocommerce-shipping-pro-chapter-7-extend-using-add-ons/">here</a> 

<strong>Per Product Shipping cost</strong>: If you define shipping cost per unit as 1 USD (instead of 10 USD in the previous example), then the value you enter in the product page can be considered as Shipping Cost per product.

So, with this add-on, you can make use of the flexibility offered by Shipping Pro for shipping calculations at product level.
